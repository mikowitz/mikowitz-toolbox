h1. Mikowitz's Toolbox

Based on an idea by "John Trupiano":http://www.github.com/jtrupiano/johns-toolbox, this is a (currently very) small repository of some custom scripts that I use with some degree of regularity.

h2. myack

My preferred output configuration for ack results. Other ack options can be passed as normal.


h2. parse_vc_branch

A custom shell prompt that will provide information about the status of a local Git or SVN repository relative to the remote HEAD.

The code for git output is from "Thomas Mayfield":http://github.com/thegreatape/dot-files.

h3. Example output:

h4. Git:

In a clean working directory
<code>/path/to/git/repo (master) $</code>

With one local commit ahead of the remote
<code>/path/to/git/repo (master+1) $</code>


h4. SVN:

In a clean working directory
<code>/path/to/svn/repo depth:0 (clean) $</code>

With 1 added file, 2 deleted files, 3 modified files, and 1 untracked file. In the shell, these numbers are colorized, and show stats relative to the root of the current project, rather than the current subdirectory.
<code>/path/to/svn/repo depth:0 ( 1 2 3 1 ) $</code>

h3. Usage

include the line <code>source /path/to/parse_vc_branch</code> in your .bashrc, etc. file

h2. svnroot

Returns you to the root directory of your current SVN project.
