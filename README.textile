h1. Mikowitz's Toolbox

Based on an idea by John Trupiano (http://www.github.com/jtrupiano/johns-toolbox), 
this is a (currently very) small repository of some custom scripts that I use with
some degree of regularity.

h2. myack

My preferred output configuration for ack results. Other ack options can be passed as normal.


h2. parse_vc_branch

A custom shell prompt that will provide information about the status of a local 
Git or SVN repository relative to the remote HEAD.

The code for git output is from Thomas Mayfield (http://github.com/thegreatape/dot-files)

Example output:

h3. Git:

In a clean working directory
<code>/path/to/git/repo (master) $</code>

With one local commit ahead of the remote
<code>/path/to/git/repo (master+1) $</code>


h3. SVN:

In a clean working directory
<code>/path/to/svn/repo (clean) $</code>

With 2 modified files
<code>/path/to/svn/repo (2 changed files) $</code>

h4. Usage

include the line <code>source /path/to/parse_vc_branch</code> in your .bashrc, etc. file
